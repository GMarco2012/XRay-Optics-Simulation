Within this folder there are mostly code that was used to learn how to do different 3D plots. The file was in Jupyter because originally I did not have access to the computer on campus.

This file will be updated with any files changes/additions to this folder.

To run .ipynb I recommend using Jupyter Notebook. You can get this by downloading Anaconda, on you own computer. This will download both python and Jupyter Notebook. Note: If you have take CS331 in python you should already have this.

Note: If you get and error while running the file Types_of_Plots.ipynb this is most likely a line endings error. This may happen because a student currently working on it is taking a class (CS450) that made it so that line endings weren't being put in Github correctly. To fix you can manually change it on Notepad ++ or just google it.
